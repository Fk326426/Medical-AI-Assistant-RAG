# Medical-AI-Assistant-RAG
I built this Medical AI to provide fast, reliable first-aid advice grounded in the St John Ambulance Manual. By using RAG and 4-bit quantization, it delivers safe, accurate answers via voice or text without hallucinations. I overcame complex library conflicts to ensure a seamless, high-performance experience on T4 GPUs.
